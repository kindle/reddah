          <li>When you submit a post or comment to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of your posts and comments, the username associated with your posts or comments, and the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment.

      <br/>
      <h3>Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddah does not link to or provide your actual Reddah account details to these advertising partners.

      <br/>
      <h3><b>Analytics Partners</b></h3>
      <br/>
